Decided to scrap current inventory system
due to multiple glitches and to restart 
with a new tutorial.

Movement drifts down for some reason so 
eventualy will be revised

Currently, Health bar has finally been 
implemented. If space bar is pressed, 
the Player's will take 20 points damage

Menu and pause will be implemented 
After adding travelling between scenes 

**Edit: Around 10:18 on May 13, 2020, Unity began to glitch 
and remove components or items connected to them
this includes the following:
-the player movement spontanously removing or drifting
-the player health bar no longer connecting to the code 
thus becoming only an image rather than a health monitor
-gradient in bar deleted
-this also made damage impossible to inflict
-audio source no longer plays background music

Unsure if there will be a way to restore damage let alone in time for submissions
apologies if the later is the case

I tried my best 

Edit 2: !0 48 and while the gradient no longer works
the health bar is up and running while also still able to inflict damage
damage is 20 pts if space bar is pressed
and for some reason that alone revived the audio as well
???????

Player still drifts
